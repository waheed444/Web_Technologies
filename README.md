## Project Overview

**Teachable Machine** is an intuitive, web-based platform developed by **Google** to simplify machine learning model creation for non-programmers and rapid prototyping. It leverages **transfer learning** to allow users to train classification models using images, audio, or body posesâ€”all without writing any code.

## Tools & Frameworks

### 1. Teachable Machine (by Google)
- **Type**: Web-based ML Training Platform  
- **Features**:
  - Drag-and-drop interface
  - Real-time input via webcam or microphone
  - Instant model training and testing
- **Use Case**: Suitable for education, prototyping, and small-scale AI experiments.

### 2. TensorFlow.js
- **Type**: JavaScript Machine Learning Library  
- **Use Case**: Enables running trained models in the browser using JavaScript.  
- **Benefit**: Client-side inference, no backend required.

### 3. TensorFlow (Python)
- **Type**: Open-source ML Framework  
- **Use Case**: Backend processing, integration with data pipelines, model fine-tuning.  
- **Formats**: `.h5` (Keras) or `SavedModel`

### 4. Input Devices
- **Webcam**: Used for image and pose projects  
- **Microphone**: Used for audio projects

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Access the Platform
Navigate to: [https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com)

### Step 2: Select Project Type
Choose from the following:
- **Image Project**: For object, gesture, or environment classification
- **Audio Project**: For detecting speech or sound patterns
- **Pose Project**: For body position detection and analysis

### Step 3: Define Classes
Create distinct categories for your model to recognize:
- Examples: `Happy`, `Sad`, `Jumping`, `Clapping`
- Upload sample data or use real-time capture

### Step 4: Train the Model
- Click the **â€œTrain Modelâ€** button
- Internally uses transfer learning for efficient training
- Training time depends on sample size and input type

### Step 5: Test the Model
- Test predictions using live webcam or mic input
- View real-time prediction scores and confidence levels

### Step 6: Export the Trained Model
- Choose export format based on your deployment needs:
  - **TensorFlow.js** for web apps
  - **TensorFlow** for Python apps
  - **Coral** for edge devices

## Use Case Examples

- **Web-based Gesture Recognition**: Train a model to identify hand gestures in-browser.
- **Sound-activated Triggers**: Use voice or clap to control devices or trigger scripts.
- **Posture Correction App**: Detect user body pose during workouts.
- **Educational Tools**: Teach core ML concepts through live demos.
