# üì± Android Activity Lifecycle  üöÄ



**Understanding the Android Activity Lifecycle for Mobile/App Development**

The Activity Lifecycle is the sequence of states an activity goes through from the moment it's created until it's destroyed. It defines how an app behaves as users open, interact with, minimize, or close it.

- Understanding the lifecycle helps developers manage:
- UI state (like screen rotations)
- App performance
- Resource usage (like memory or battery)
- Saving/restoring user data.

The Android system automatically calls lifecycle methods to handle transitions between states, such as when the user navigates away from the activity or returns to it.

In short, the lifecycle ensures your app responds correctly to user actions and system events.
In Android development, an `Activity` represents a single, focused thing the user can do.  Think of it as a single screen with a user interface. The Activity Lifecycle defines the sequence of states an activity goes through from its creation to its destruction. Mastering this lifecycle is paramount for building stable, efficient, and well-behaved Android applications.

## üîÑ Activity Lifecycle Overview

## üîπ Lifecycle Methods Explained

### 1. `onCreate()`

- Called when the activity is **first created**.  This is your entry point.
- Used for **initializing UI components**, setting the content view (`setContentView()`), and performing other crucial startup logic.  This is where you should perform one-time setup tasks.

```kotlin
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
    // Initialize UI components and other resources here
}
```

### 2. `onStart()`

- Called when the activity becomes visible to the user.  The activity is not yet in the foreground and not yet interactive.

### 3. `onResume()`

- Called when the activity starts interacting with the user.  The activity is now at the top of the activity stack and has focus.  This is where you should start animations, register broadcast receivers, or initiate network requests.

### 4. `onPause()`

- Called when the system is about to start another activity.  This is your opportunity to pause animations, commit unsaved changes, and release resources that are not needed while the activity is in the background.  Keep this method short and efficient.

### 5. `onStop()`

- Called when the activity is no longer visible to the user.  This is the time to release more expensive resources.  The activity may be completely destroyed or restarted later.


### 6. `onRestart()`

- Called after the activity has been stopped, just before it is started again.

### 7. `onDestroy()`

- Called before the activity is destroyed.  Use this to perform final cleanup of resources and prevent memory leaks.


## üîÅ Practical Use Cases

| Lifecycle Method | Common Uses                                         |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `onCreate()`       | Initialize UI, set content view, one-time setup       |
| `onStart()`        | Register broadcast receivers                        |
| `onResume()`       | Start animations, initialize interactive components |
| `onPause()`        | Pause animations, save unsaved data                 |
| `onStop()`         | Release expensive resources                         |
| `onDestroy()`      | Final cleanup to avoid memory leaks                 |


## üß™ Tips for Developers

* Avoid heavy operations in `onCreate()`. Perform long-running tasks in background threads or using coroutines.
* Always release resources in `onPause()` and `onStop()` to save battery and memory.
* Use `ViewModel` and `LiveData` for better lifecycle-aware data management.  This helps prevent data loss and memory leaks.
